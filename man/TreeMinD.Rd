\title{Minimum Difference Test for Tree Ordered Alternatives}
\usage{
TreeMinD(sample_data, significance_level)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_data}{A list of numeric vectors. The first element represents the control group, the others represent treatment groups.}

\item{significance_level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the significance level for the test (e.g., 0.05).}
}
\value{
A character string with the critical value, the Min-D test statistic, and the test decision.
}
\description{
Computes a test statistic based on the minimum standardized difference between the treatment means and the control mean under the tree order restriction.
}
\details{
The test statistic is the minimum of standardized differences between each treatment mean and the control mean. The critical value is estimated by a bootstrap procedure.
